# SSD For Text Detection and Reading

### Overview

1. For SSD text detection testing code, see /examples/ssd/python. Further documentation is presented within that folder

2. For prototxt files for text reading, see /examples/ocr/90ksynth

3. For prototxt files and testing code for the combined text detection/word readin network, see /examples/ocr. This folder also contains the code for performing net surgery to combine the pre-trained weights for the detection and reading network. as well as the net surgery code to combine detection and read. Further documentation is presented within that folder

4. For ipython notebooks for testing text detection, tex reading, and the full combined network, see /examples. Further documentation is provided within that folder.

5. For networks and code that test the spatial transformer network on MNIST, see examples/mnist. Further documentation provided within the folder

6. For the new python layers and utility functions, see /examples/pycaffe/layers. Add this folder to the python path to enable running python layers. ADD INFO ABOUT HOW TO UPDATE MAKE FILE AND HOW TO SPECIFY A LAYER
